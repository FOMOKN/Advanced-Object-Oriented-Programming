A game named Numberle (Java)

Numberle is a mathematical equation guessing game where players must accurately guess a randomly generated equation within six tries.1 Players enter their own equation, aiming to match the target equation. In total, players have 6 attempts to guess the target equation. When calculating, players can use numbers (0-9) and arithmetic signs (+ - * / =).

One version will have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the other version will have a command-line interface (CLI). 

The GUI version will be constructed according to the principles of Model View Controller, and the CLI version will use the same model.
